More of me playing tabs from [Paul Asbell](https://paulasbell.com)!
Here's me playing Isn't She Lovely on two parts with guitar.
I did this in one take, so it is pretty sloppy!

<style>
  .full-width-video {
    width: 100%; 
    max-width: 1200px; /* Optional: prevents excessive width on very large screens */
    height: auto;
    margin: 0 auto; /* Centers video if using max-width */
  }
</style>
