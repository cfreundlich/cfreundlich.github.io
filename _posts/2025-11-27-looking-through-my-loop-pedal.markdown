I wanted something to do on the long flight from California to France,
and with the kids staying home with grandparents, I made sure
to download the audio files from my BOSS RC-500 loop station.

First of all, this thing is great if you play more than one instrument.
It has stereo I/O, so you can play with two instruments, isolated to
their own amps, but synced and quantized to the same click.  

This has been awesome for my pocket, but I have a long way to go!
I'm working on my Nile Rogers. What do you think?

The sixteenth notes chops are really fun -- here's a solo jam on just a 1-6-2-5.

I busted out my mic and sang some, but the audio didn't record one of
my favorite Vulf songs:

Finally, sitting on this flight, I was getting creative and started
to arrange an idea I had in the music room last week.
Still half formed but kind of cool right?
