Here's an embedded video of me playing the Hofner, which does not work for me in 
Safari but is fine in Chrome.  The problem is definitely with this file, which I created with MacOS PhotoBooth, then imported that in Photos, exported to .mov, then converted to what should be a very highly compatible format with ffmpeg:

```
fmpeg -i ~/Downloads/hofner.mov -c:v copy -c:a libfdk_aac -ar 48000 -b:a 160k -ac 2 ~/Downloads/hofner.mp4
```

I will update this post when I figure out what is wrong with this file!
