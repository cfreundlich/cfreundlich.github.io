I have come a long way learning from [Paul Asbell](https://paulasbell.com)!
Here's me playing Happy Thumb from Roots and Branches. 
It ain't perfect, but I wanted to put some videos on here...

<style>
  .full-width-video {
    width: 100%; 
    max-width: 1200px; /* Optional: prevents excessive width on very large screens */
    height: auto;
    margin: 0 auto; /* Centers video if using max-width */
  }
</style>

<video class="full-width-video" controls>
  <source src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cfreundlich.github.io/ht.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
