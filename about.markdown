# Career Summary
Over the last six years, I have reported directly to Tesla’s most demanding and inspiring executives. Together, we have accomplished a lot with the S3XY models, and there is so much left to do across vehicles and batteries as we accelerate the global transition to sustainable energy.

I am responsible for all components of the products my team develops, including R&D, product management, networks, edge components, web development, and technical operations/maintenance/support. To support this scope, I have built software teams, analytics, SRE, and technician workforces. I have led these teams across tens of facilities in multiple continents to deliver critical wins that drove exponential growth from Model S to Cybertruck. Computer vision, advanced analytics, and distributed systems are common threads.

Prior to my global scope, I operated as a software engineering and R&D manager (still do for vision research team). Prior to that, I was a software engineer at Tesla working on Supply Chain Automation during Model 3 hell. And prior to that, I earned a doctorate in AI and Robotics from Duke University. 

Above all, I genuinely love every aspect of the scientific and engineering process, and I’m grateful to be a part of a community of brilliant engineers that I have come to know throughout my career.
