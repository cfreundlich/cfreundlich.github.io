My name is Charlie Freundlich. I'm a musician and software engineer. I currently live in the San Diego area and have worked for Tesla since 2016, although the content and opinions on this blog are completely my own.

My core values are *integrity* and *curiosity*.
Integrity means honoring the true self.
Curiosity means searching for the true nature of the reality (including the self).
These values drive me to pursue the most important things in my life: Family, Music, Math, and Engineering.

Integrity and curiosity are only possible with compassion.
Certainty is the opposite of curiosity and the enemy of compassion.
When I feel certain, I channel [Thích Nhất Hạnh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thích_Nhất_Hạnh) and ask myself "are you sure?"

I make mistakes all the time.
I do care what people (including me) think when I'm not skillful.
I think it is more important to fix mistakes quickly than avoid making them.

Do not confuse *caring* what others think with *fearing* what others think.
[Fear of Other People's Opinions (FOPO)](https://hbr.org/2023/09/free-your-people-from-the-need-for-social-approval) is at an all-time high in our society.
I try to avoid that.
