I'm a father, a musician, and an engineer. I currently live in the San Diego area and have worked for Tesla since 2016, although the content and opinions on this blog are completely my own.

My core values are *integrity* and *curiosity*.
<!-- Integrity means honoring the true self. -->
<!-- Curiosity means searching for the true nature of the reality (including the self). -->
<!-- They are my source of motivation in life. -->
<!-- Integrity and curiosity are only possible with compassion. -->
<!-- Certainty is the opposite of curiosity and the enemy of compassion.
When I feel certain, I channel [Thích Nhất Hạnh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thích_Nhất_Hạnh) and ask myself "are you sure?" -->
I make mistakes a lot.
I care what people think when I'm not skillful, but I would rather have to fix mistakes than avoid making them.
I try not to confuse *caring* with *fearing* what others think.
[Fear of Other People's Opinions (FOPO)](https://hbr.org/2023/09/free-your-people-from-the-need-for-social-approval) is a thing.
I try to avoid it.
