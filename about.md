I'm a father, a musician, and an engineer. I currently live in the San Diego area and have worked for Tesla since 2016, although the content and opinions on this blog are completely my own.

<!-- My core values are *integrity* and *curiosity*. -->
<!-- Integrity means honoring the true self. -->
<!-- Curiosity means searching for the true nature of the reality (including the self). -->
<!-- They are my source of motivation in life. -->
<!-- Integrity and curiosity are only possible with compassion. -->
<!-- Certainty is the opposite of curiosity and the enemy of compassion.
When I feel certain, I channel [Thích Nhất Hạnh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thích_Nhất_Hạnh) and ask myself "are you sure?" -->
<!-- I make mistakes a lot. -->
<!-- I care what people think when I'm not skillful, but I fix mistakes than avoid making them.
I try not to confuse *caring* with *fearing* what others think. -->

A few things about me:
- I care what people think, but I try very hard to overcome [FOPO](https://hbr.org/2023/09/free-your-people-from-the-need-for-social-approval). 
- Some Buddhist monk ([Thích Nhất Hạnh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thích_Nhất_Hạnh)?) once said something I think about a lot: "you can't have truth without compassion," or "certainty is the enemy of truth." I think they mean basically the same thing, and I try to apply them to every aspect of my life.
<!-- - I found out recently that Jewish people that get into Buddhism in their 30s have a name: Jew-Bu. -->
- I am very bad at rote memorization and filling out forms.  I chose physics for this reason - so that I could derive the formulas on the test.  I foolishly switched to engineering because I didn't think I was smart enough to get a PhD in physics.
- We should all burn our phones in a pire.
