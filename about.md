My name is Charlie Freundlich. I'm a musician and software engineer. I currently live in the San Diego area and have worked for Tesla since 2016, although the content and opinions on this blog are completely my own.

Professionally speaking, I’m a manager, researcher, and software engineer with expertise in distributed systems, computer vision, AI, and automation. 

I’ve led global teams in supply chain, design, manufacturing, and quality systems, driving innovation and operational excellence. 

I’m driven by integrity and curiosity, value transparent communication, and am a committed advocate for climate action and environmental justice.
